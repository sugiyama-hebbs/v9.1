Basic task protocol is n washout -> 1S -> 1 NoFeedback. (n is set to 10 for now, but could be shorter).
This can be modified to various versions, such as washout -> 1TE -> 1S -> 1 NoFeedback to test if disruption of reward (TE) info is associated with reduction of learning.

Although not likely a severe confound, there may be meta-learning effects within a block as cycle is repeated.
Therefore, tms location is manually pseudo-randomized so that exactly the each location appears exactly in the same number of times in each order. This sequenec is labeled as day1b.
