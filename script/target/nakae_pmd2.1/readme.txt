Modified for experiment with TMS on Pre-motor cortex

2021/8/6

Basic task protocol is n washout -> 1S -> 1 NoFeedback. (n is set to 10 for now, but could be shorter).
This can be modified to various versions, such as washout -> 1TE -> 1S -> 1 NoFeedback to test if disruption of reward (TE) info is associated with reduction of learning.
